# User Management System

## 👤 Profiles
Every user has a profile page containing:
*   **Personal Info**: Name, Course, Email.
*   **Stats**: Number of posts created.
*   **Activity**: A feed of their own posts.

## 👮‍♂️ Moderator Capabilities
Moderators have a special dashboard to:
1.  **Create Organizations**: Add new orgs to the system.
2.  **Edit Organizations**: Update descriptions or logos.
3.  **Assign Heads**: Promote a Standard User to an "Organization Head".

## 🎓 Organization Heads
*   Represent specific student bodies (e.g., SITE, USG).
*   Their posts carry the Organization's branding (Name/Logo) instead of their personal name.
*   They manage the digital presence of their assigned org.
